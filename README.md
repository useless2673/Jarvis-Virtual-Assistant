# Jarvis: AI Powered Virtual Assistant in Python

## Overview

Jarvis is a Python-based AI-powered virtual assistant designed to help users automate tasks, answer queries, and interact with their computer using natural language. Inspired by the famous Jarvis from Iron Man, this assistant leverages modern AI and NLP technologies to provide a seamless, voice-activated experience.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition & Synthesis:** Understands spoken commands and responds verbally.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Uses NLP to interpret and execute user requests.
- **Task Automation:** Can open applications, search the web, send emails, and more.
- **Customizable Skills:** Easily add new commands or skills to extend functionality.
- **Integration:** Connects with APIs (weather, news, calendar, etc.) for real-time information.
- **Personalization:** Learns from user interactions for improved performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
- OpenAI GPT (for advanced NLP)
- Other libraries: requests, datetime, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jarvis-ai.git
    cd jarvis-ai
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure API Keys (if needed)**
    - For GPT or third-party APIs, set API keys in a `.env` file or config section.

### Usage

Run Jarvis with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Speak your command after the prompt. Example commands:

- "Jarvis, what's the weather today?"
- "Open Spotify."
- "Send an email to John Doe."
- "Set a reminder for 8 PM."
